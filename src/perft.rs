/// Counts legal move paths of a given length.
///
/// Shorter paths (due to mate or stalemate) are not counted.
/// Computing perft numbers is useful for comparing, testing and
/// debugging move generation correctness and performance.
///
/// The method used here is simply recursively enumerating the entire tree of
/// legal moves. While this is fine for testing there is much
/// faster specialized software.
///
/// Warning: Computing perft numbers can take a long time, even at moderate
/// depths. The simple recursive algorithm can also overflow the stack at
/// high depths, but this will only come into consideration in the rare case
/// that high depths are feasible at all.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use shakmaty::{Chess, perft};
///
/// let pos = Chess::default();
/// assert_eq!(perft(&pos, 1), 20);
/// assert_eq!(perft(&pos, 2), 400);
/// assert_eq!(perft(&pos, 3), 8902);
/// ```
